  abstract = {Vehicles can be used to facilitate humans in carrying out their daily activities. Motorized vehicles are divided into 3: land, sea, and air. Apart from the many benefits that can be obtained, motorized vehicles have dangers related to high-risk accidents. The highest cause of motorized vehicle accidents on land is road damage due to overload vehicles. Brake failure due to overload vehicles also contributes to vehicle accidents. This research aims to create an Internet of Things (IoT) based application to detect motorized vehicle load conditions. It was combined with several other technologies to produce a tool for detecting motor vehicle load conditions. The Extreme Programming Method is being used in this research. The Extreme Programming method is considered more suitable for completing this research because the communication with stakeholders is quite different. The Extreme Programming Method enables it to go back to the next step if discrepancies are encountered in making the system. The result of this research is an IoT-based tool called e-overload. It can detect vehicle loads, provide information for the drivers, and inform the results to related officers at the same time. E-overload tool will enable the drivers to get real-time information on the load on their vehicles. Officers will get additional evidence and the latest position of the vehicle to carry out actions against motorists who operate their vehicles with excessive loads.},

  abstract = {TypeScript has conquered the world of JavaScript. Identified in developer surveys as one of the world's fastest growing and most popular languages, TypeScript is widely used in consumer and business companies across the world and is frequently credited for helping massive web applications scale. But what exactly is TypeScript? How and why does it work, and how can we use it?This practical book takes beginner and advanced JavaScript programmers alike from knowing nothing about "types" or "type systems" to full mastery of TypeScript fundamentals.You'll learn:Benefits of TypeScript and general characteristics of its type systemWhy and how TypeScript is useful on top of "vanilla" JavaScriptHow to inform your type system by using development-only type annotationsHow TypeScript analyzes and understands code to help you augment your existing development patternsHow TypeScript helps you work with arrays, classes, functions, objects, and other important built-in JavaScript constructsHow to effectively use the plethora of TypeScript configuration options to tailor the TypeScript compiler to your teams and projectsA variety of IDE integrations such as automated refactors and intelligent code searches provided by TypeScript to help you develop quickly with fewer bugs},
